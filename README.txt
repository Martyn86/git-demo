## Lorem Ipsum
With get, interpret the name as a regular expression. Regular expression matching is currently case-sensitive and done against a canonicalized version of the key in which section and variable names are lowercased, but subsection names are not.

When given a two-part <name> as <section>.<key>, the value for <section>.<URL>.<key> whose <URL> part matches the best to the given URL is returned (if no such key exists, the value for <section>.<key> is used as a fallback). When given just the <section> as name, do so for all the keys in the section and list them. Returns error code 1 if no value is found.
